# Description
This is a collection of my current CSS files that I am using for Firefox. I've definitely copy/pasted them from various sources and then adjust to fit my needs. I haven't dropped any comments / links in them but I also haven't done a great job of attributing my sources 🤷🏼‍♂️ 

## How To Use
- Search how to add custom CSS to Firefox
- Copy the contents of whichever file you prefer into that custom CSS file
- Relaunch Firefox

### Contributing
I'm open to pull requests on here, but it's probably best to fork this and make whatever changes you want as I know I'm kind of needy when it comes to my setup
